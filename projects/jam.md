# Game Jam

A simple platformer inspired by 80s command line games.
It uses Conway's Game of Life as the ground,
and is generally a very difficult game.
It was made in a day, so it's generally unpolished.

If you're up to the challenge, the game is [here](https://hhhhhhhhhn.github.io/jam/),
and the code is [here](https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/jam)
