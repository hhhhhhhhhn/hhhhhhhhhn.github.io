# autoarch

An automated installer for Arch Linux,
with a simple TUI interface.
The main focus was on the extensibility and native support,
so it's written in POSIX compliant shell.

You can find the main part [here](https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/autoarch),
an LXDE example [here](https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/autoarchlxde)
and the ISO image creator [here](https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/autoarchiso)
