# wr

A work-in-progress simple vim-like text editor,
with multiple cursors as its base concept.
It is written from scratch in Go,
using my custom [rope implementation](#rope)
and [curses alternative](#hexes).
Its goal is to be kept simple and customizable,
so it uses higher order functions to represent
both actions and movements.

It can be found is [here](https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/wr)
