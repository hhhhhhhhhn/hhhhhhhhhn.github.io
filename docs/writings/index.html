			<h1><h1>Rust is Nice</h1>
<p>After putting it off for years,
I finally learned Rust.
Even though it has been the most loved programming language <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">since 2016</a>,
I still could not get over the complex-appearing syntax.
Luckily, I was planning on making a program in C and had a lot of free time,
so I decided to do it in a new programming language.
After quickly considering APL,
I noticed that it was probably the time to learn Rust.
Now I understand why people like it...</p></h1>

			<h1><h1>Markdown: A Patch for the Modern Web</h1>
<p>I think it is no secret that websites have become worse with time.
From ads to pop-ups to terrible load times,
it seems that looking stuff up gets harder as every second goes by.
People have tried to reform the Internet.
Projects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a><a href="#gopher" class="footnote">1</a>
and <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> come to mind.
Although they have been very successful in their niches (including me),
I find it hard to believe regular people are using them.
I think the solution is often overlooked in between attempts to reinvent the wheel.
It is a format that is already widely used: Markdown...</p></h1>

			<h1><h1>Approximating ùëí in 6¬Ω Programming Languages</h1>
<p>I often use programming languages to play around with mathematical problems,
as they are often the fastest option to quickly iterate over ideas.
I have used the usual scripting options, like Python, JavaScript, Julia, Go, and even <code>bc</code>.
That left me wanting to compare some of them,
but then I noticed I could use the opportunity to compare a more diverse range of languages.
This is the result of the comparison...</p></h1>

			<h1><h1>Testing 3 Common Shell Optimizations</h1>
<p>Although worrying about performance in shell scripts seems ironic at first (at least to me),
I have seen enough tips to become curious about the actual benefits of some of them.
So, I decided to put three common ones to the test, with <a href="https://github.com/hhhhhhhhhn/bensh">a few self-made benchmarks</a>...</p></h1>
